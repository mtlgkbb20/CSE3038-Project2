Condition Steps:
If 0 -> pass
If 1 -> go recursive function
	convert this 1 to 2
	look up-down-left-right one by one recursively
	if any one of these are 1, do the same thing for them
	increase count for every 1 to 2 conversion
	at the end of the function, if count is bigger than largest island variable, set it to count
	set count 0
If 2 -> pass
